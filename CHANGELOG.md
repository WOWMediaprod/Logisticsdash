## [2025-10-23] - Multi-Stop Waypoint Management System

### üéØ **Session Focus**: Complete Route Planning with Intermediate Stops

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Production Deployed** - Multi-waypoint system with auto-creation and manager control
**Achievement**: Manager can add intermediate stops (container yards, checkpoints), client sees full route timeline
**Note**: ‚è≥ **Pending additional changes** - More features to be added before final release

### Added

#### **1. Waypoint Management System** (`/apps/api/src/modules/waypoints/`)
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Waypoint Architecture**: Switched from RouteWaypoint to Waypoint table
  - **jobId-based waypoints**: Direct job association instead of route dependency
  - **Sequence-based ordering**: Integer sequence for flexible waypoint ordering
  - **Waypoint types**: PICKUP, DELIVERY, CHECKPOINT, REST_STOP, YARD, PORT
  - **Completion tracking**: isCompleted flag with completedAt timestamp
  - **Geofencing radius**: radiusM field for proximity detection (default 150m)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-create PICKUP/DELIVERY waypoints**: Automatically generated when job request accepted
  - Preserves client-submitted pickup address from job request
  - Preserves client-submitted delivery address from job request
  - Sequence #1: Pickup location, Sequence #2+: Delivery location
  - Protected waypoints: PICKUP and DELIVERY cannot be deleted by manager
- ‚úÖ **Waypoint CRUD API**: Complete waypoint management
  - `POST /api/v1/waypoints` - Create new waypoint
  - `GET /api/v1/waypoints?jobId=xxx` - Get all waypoints for job
  - `PUT /api/v1/waypoints/:id` - Update waypoint
  - `DELETE /api/v1/waypoints/:id` - Delete waypoint (except PICKUP/DELIVERY)
  - `PATCH /api/v1/waypoints/:id/complete` - Mark waypoint as completed
  - `PATCH /api/v1/waypoints/reorder` - Reorder waypoint sequence

#### **2. WaypointManager Component** (`/apps/web/src/components/WaypointManager.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Full-Featured Timeline Display**: Visual route planning interface
  - **Numbered sequence**: Sequential waypoint display with visual indicators
  - **Waypoint type badges**: Color-coded labels (green=pickup, red=delivery, blue=checkpoint, etc.)
  - **Completion status**: Green checkmark icon for completed waypoints
  - **Address display**: Full address with map pin icon
  - **Add waypoint form**: Inline form with Places API autocomplete
  - **Edit/Delete actions**: Conditional based on waypoint type and completion status
- ‚úÖ **Places API Integration**: Uber-style address autocomplete for new waypoints
  - Reuses AddressAutocomplete component from job request form
  - Captures GPS coordinates (lat/lng) automatically
  - Works with backend proxy (ad blocker proof)
- ‚úÖ **Waypoint Type Selection**: Dropdown with 4 intermediate stop types
  - Checkpoint: General route checkpoints
  - Container Yard: Container pickup/drop locations
  - Port: Port of loading/discharge
  - Rest Stop: Driver rest areas
- ‚úÖ **Read-only Mode**: Client view without edit/delete capabilities
  - Disabled add waypoint button
  - Hidden delete/complete actions
  - Full visibility of route timeline

#### **3. Manager Dashboard Integration** (`/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/requests/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Waypoint Management Section**: Added below Route Information
  - Only visible after job request is accepted (has jobId)
  - Shows auto-created PICKUP and DELIVERY waypoints
  - Manager can add intermediate stops (container yard, checkpoint, etc.)
  - Manager can mark waypoints as complete during job execution
  - Manager can delete intermediate waypoints (not PICKUP/DELIVERY)
- ‚úÖ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between route info and waypoint management

#### **4. Client Job Detail Integration** (`/apps/web/src/app/client/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Read-only Waypoint Timeline**: Client sees full route with all stops
  - Displays all waypoints in sequence order
  - Shows waypoint types and completion status
  - No edit/delete capabilities (read-only mode)
  - Positioned after Shipment Timeline section

#### **5. Database Schema Updates** (`/apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- ‚úÖ **JobRequest Address Fields**: Added 6 new fields for client-submitted addresses
  - `pickupAddress String?` - Full pickup address text
  - `pickupLat Float?` - Pickup GPS latitude
  - `pickupLng Float?` - Pickup GPS longitude
  - `deliveryAddress String?` - Full delivery address text
  - `deliveryLat Float?` - Delivery GPS latitude
  - `deliveryLng Float?` - Delivery GPS longitude
- ‚úÖ **Waypoint Table Utilization**: Simplified from RouteWaypoint complexity
  - Direct jobId foreign key (no route dependency)
  - Simpler data model for job-specific waypoints

### Fixed

#### **1. Empty Pickup/Delivery Location Display**
- **Problem**: Manager dashboard showed empty "Pickup Location" and "Delivery Location" fields
- **Root Cause**: JobRequest model lacked fields to store client-submitted addresses
- **Fix**: Added address fields to JobRequest schema and updated service
  - `job-requests.service.ts` now saves pickupAddress, deliveryAddress with GPS coords
  - Manager dashboard displays addresses in Route Information section
- **Result**: Manager sees exactly where client wants pickup and delivery

#### **2. Waypoint Service Table Confusion**
- **Problem**: Service was using complex RouteWaypoint table with routeId dependency
- **Root Cause**: Schema had both Waypoint and RouteWaypoint tables, wrong one was selected
- **Fix**: Complete migration to simpler Waypoint table
  - Removed routeId from DTOs
  - Updated all CRUD operations to use `prisma.waypoint`
  - Changed `completedAt` field from `actualArrival` to match schema
- **Result**: Cleaner architecture, easier to manage job-specific waypoints

#### **3. Waypoint Auto-Creation Missing**
- **Problem**: When accepting job request, no waypoints were created
- **Root Cause**: Job creation logic didn't include waypoint initialization
- **Fix**: Added auto-create logic in `acceptAndCreateJob` method
  - Creates PICKUP waypoint from request.pickupAddress/Lat/Lng
  - Creates DELIVERY waypoint from request.deliveryAddress/Lat/Lng
  - Uses sequence 1 for pickup, sequence 2 for delivery
  - Sets default 150m geofence radius
- **Result**: Every accepted job starts with pickup and delivery waypoints

### Enhanced

#### **Multi-Stop Route Planning**
- **Manager Workflow**:
  1. Receive job request from client with pickup/delivery addresses
  2. Accept request ‚Üí Job created with auto-generated PICKUP/DELIVERY waypoints
  3. Add intermediate stops (container yard, checkpoint, rest stop, port)
  4. Waypoints display in sequential order with visual timeline
  5. Mark waypoints as complete as driver progresses through route
- **Client Visibility**:
  1. Submit job request with pickup/delivery addresses via autocomplete
  2. After acceptance, view job details with full waypoint timeline
  3. See all manager-added intermediate stops (container yards, checkpoints, etc.)
  4. Track completion status of each waypoint in real-time

#### **Data Flow Architecture**
```
Client Request ‚Üí JobRequest (with addresses) ‚Üí Job Acceptance ‚Üí
Auto-create Waypoints (PICKUP + DELIVERY) ‚Üí Manager Adds Stops ‚Üí
Full Route Timeline Visible to Both Parties
```

#### **Waypoint Type System**
- **PICKUP**: Auto-created, sequence #1, cannot delete, green badge
- **DELIVERY**: Auto-created, final sequence, cannot delete, red badge
- **CHECKPOINT**: Manager-added, blue badge, can edit/delete
- **YARD**: Container yard stops, yellow badge, can edit/delete
- **PORT**: Port locations, purple badge, can edit/delete
- **REST_STOP**: Driver rest areas, gray badge, can edit/delete

### Technical Improvements

#### **Component Reusability**
- WaypointManager component used in both manager and client views
- `readOnly` prop controls edit/delete functionality
- Conditional rendering based on waypoint type and permissions

#### **Sequential Waypoint Management**
```typescript
// Auto-calculate next sequence number
const sequence = waypoints.length + 1;

// Create waypoint with sequence
await prisma.waypoint.create({
  data: { jobId, name, type, sequence, address, lat, lng }
});
```

#### **Protected Waypoint Logic**
```typescript
// Cannot delete PICKUP or DELIVERY waypoints
{waypoint.type !== 'PICKUP' && waypoint.type !== 'DELIVERY' && (
  <button onClick={() => handleDeleteWaypoint(waypoint.id)}>
    <Trash2 />
  </button>
)}
```

### Files Modified

**Backend API:**
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` (Added JobRequest address fields)
- `apps/api/src/modules/waypoints/waypoints.service.ts` (Switched to Waypoint table)
- `apps/api/src/modules/waypoints/dto/create-waypoint.dto.ts` (Removed routeId)
- `apps/api/src/modules/job-requests/job-requests.service.ts` (Auto-create waypoints + address fields)

**Frontend:**
- `apps/web/src/components/WaypointManager.tsx` (Created - 326 lines)
- `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/requests/page.tsx` (Integrated WaypointManager)
- `apps/web/src/app/client/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` (Integrated read-only WaypointManager)

### Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ **Render API**: Live with waypoint auto-creation and CRUD endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Vercel Frontend**: Auto-deployed with WaypointManager component
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Schema updated with JobRequest address fields
- ‚úÖ **Commit**: `f204473` - "feat: Implement multi-stop waypoint management system"

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual Waypoint Completion**: Manager must manually mark waypoints as complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Automatic Status Change**: Driver proximity to waypoint doesn't auto-complete waypoint
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Geofencing Logic**: radiusM field stored but not yet used for proximity detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Waypoint Reordering UI**: API supports reordering, but UI doesn't allow drag-and-drop yet

### Future Enhancements (Pending)
1. **Automatic Waypoint Completion**: Geofence-based auto-completion when driver enters radius
2. **Status Change Triggers**: Auto-update job status when reaching certain waypoints
   - Arrival at PICKUP ‚Üí Status: AT_PICKUP
   - Departure from PICKUP ‚Üí Status: LOADED
   - Arrival at DELIVERY ‚Üí Status: AT_DELIVERY
   - Completion of DELIVERY ‚Üí Status: DELIVERED
3. **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Visual waypoint sequence management
4. **ETA Calculations**: Estimated arrival time for each waypoint based on distance/traffic
5. **Waypoint Notifications**: Alert driver when approaching next waypoint
6. **Route Optimization**: Suggest optimal waypoint sequence based on distance

### Testing Notes
- ‚úÖ Old job requests (created before schema update) won't have pickup/delivery addresses
- ‚úÖ Test with NEW job request to see full waypoint functionality
- ‚úÖ Waypoints only appear AFTER accepting job request (when jobId is created)
- ‚úÖ PICKUP and DELIVERY waypoints protected from deletion

### Developer Notes
- **Waypoint vs RouteWaypoint**: Simplified to use Waypoint table with direct jobId association
- **Auto-creation Pattern**: Waypoints created in transaction immediately after job creation
- **Protected Waypoint Logic**: Type-based permissions prevent deletion of system-generated waypoints
- **Component Pattern**: Single WaypointManager component with readOnly mode for client view
- **Sequence Management**: Auto-calculated based on current waypoint count

## [2025-10-23] - Google Places API Migration & Dashboard Reliability Improvements

### üéØ **Session Focus**: Address Autocomplete Modernization & Cold Start Handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Production Deployed** - Uber-style autocomplete with backend proxy and automatic retry logic
**Achievement**: Migrated to Google Places API (New), fixed intermittent dashboard loading issues

### Added

#### **1. Google Places API (New) Integration** (`/apps/api/src/modules/geocoding/`)
- ‚úÖ **Backend Proxy Implementation**: Complete geocoding module with backend API proxy
  - **Geocoding Service**: `geocoding.service.ts` with Places API (New) endpoints
  - **Autocomplete Endpoint**: POST request to `https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:autocomplete`
  - **Place Details Endpoint**: GET request to `https://places.googleapis.com/v1/{placeId}`
  - **Header-based Authentication**: `X-Goog-Api-Key` header instead of query parameters
  - **Field Masks**: `X-Goog-FieldMask` for response optimization
- ‚úÖ **DTOs Created**:
  - `autocomplete-query.dto.ts` - Query validation with country, latitude, longitude
  - `PlaceDetailsDto` - PlaceId validation for coordinate fetching
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Interfaces**: Exported interfaces for type safety
  - `AutocompleteSuggestion` - Suggestion format with placeId, name, address
  - `PlaceDetails` - Complete place data with GPS coordinates
- ‚úÖ **Controller Endpoints**: REST API for frontend consumption
  - `GET /api/v1/geocoding/autocomplete` - Address suggestions
  - `POST /api/v1/geocoding/place-details` - GPS coordinate fetching
  - `GET /api/v1/geocoding/geocode` - Direct address geocoding
- **Security**: API key secured server-side, not exposed to browser

#### **2. Uber-Style Address Autocomplete Component** (`/apps/web/src/components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Custom React Component**: Complete replacement for browser-based Google Places SDK
  - **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to reduce API calls
  - **Dropdown Suggestions**: Uber-style UI with location icons
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, Escape support
  - **GPS Coordinate Capture**: Automatic lat/lng fetching on selection
- ‚úÖ **Ad Blocker Proof**: Backend proxy prevents ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT errors
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch-optimized dropdown with proper z-index handling
- ‚úÖ **Loading States**: Spinner during API requests
- **Integration**: Used in client job request form and waypoint management

#### **3. Dashboard Retry Logic for Render Cold Starts** (`/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff**:
  - **Retry Strategy**: Up to 3 attempts with 1s, 2s, 4s delays
  - **Extended Timeout**: 60-second timeout for initial requests
  - **Smart Retry Logic**: Detects timeouts and connection failures
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Loading States**:
  - Attempt 1: "Loading dashboard..."
  - Attempt 2: "Connecting to server..."
  - Attempt 3+: "Server is waking up, please wait..."
  - Helper text: "This may take up to a minute if the server was sleeping..."
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery UI**:
  - Clear error message when all retries fail
  - Manual "Try Again" button for user-initiated retry
  - Informative message explaining cold start behavior
- **Root Cause**: Render free tier sleeps services after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Solution**: Gracefully handle 30-60 second wake-up delays

### Fixed

#### **1. Google Places API REQUEST_DENIED Error**
- **Problem**: Legacy Places API deprecated as of March 1, 2025 for new customers
  - Error: "This API key is not authorized to use this service or API"
  - Old endpoint: `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/autocomplete/json`
- **Root Cause**: Attempting to use deprecated API with new Google Cloud project
- **Fix**: Migrated to Places API (New) with completely different endpoint structure
  - New autocomplete: `https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:autocomplete` (POST)
  - New place details: `https://places.googleapis.com/v1/{placeId}` (GET)
  - PlaceId format: `places/ChIJ...` instead of `ChIJ...`
- **Result**: All autocomplete and geocoding endpoints working correctly
- **Commits**: `407d884`, `33c7a6a`, `98c6fcb`, `3952daf`

#### **2. Ad Blocker Blocking Google Maps SDK (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT)**
- **Problem**: Browser-based Google Places SDK blocked by ad blockers (uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger)
- **Root Cause**: Direct loading of `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js` flagged as tracking script
- **Fix**: Implemented complete backend proxy pattern
  - All Google API calls go through NestJS backend
  - API key never exposed to browser
  - No external scripts loaded in frontend
- **Result**: Autocomplete works regardless of ad blocker settings
- **Commit**: `407d884`

#### **3. TypeScript Build Errors - Interface Visibility**
- **Problem**: Vercel build failing with "Return type has or is using name from external module"
- **Root Cause**: Interfaces defined inside service file not exported
- **Fix**: Created `interfaces/geocoding.interface.ts` with exported interfaces
- **Commit**: `7700357`

#### **4. Missing axios Dependency**
- **Problem**: Render build failing with "Cannot find module 'axios'"
- **Root Cause**: New geocoding service uses axios but it wasn't in package.json
- **Fix**: Added axios to API dependencies (`pnpm add axios --filter api`)
- **Commit**: `7700357`

#### **5. Wrong API Endpoint URLs (404 Errors)**
- **Problem**: Frontend getting 404 on `/geocoding/autocomplete`
- **Root Cause**: API has global prefix `/api/v1` but frontend wasn't including it
- **Fix**: Updated AddressAutocomplete component to use correct URL format
  - Before: `/geocoding/autocomplete`
  - After: `/api/v1/geocoding/autocomplete`
- **Commit**: `33c7a6a`

#### **6. PlaceId Format Mismatch (400 Bad Request)**
- **Problem**: Place details endpoint returning 400 when fetching GPS coordinates
- **Root Cause**: Places API (New) expects placeId in format `places/ChIJ...` not just `ChIJ...`
- **Fix**: Added normalization in service to ensure correct format
- **Commit**: `3952daf`

#### **7. Job Requests Page TypeError**
- **Problem**: Page crashing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')"
- **Root Cause**: Some job requests don't have pickupAddress/deliveryAddress populated
- **Fix**: Added optional chaining and fallback text
  - Before: `request.pickupAddress.split(',')[0]`
  - After: `request.pickupAddress?.split(',')[0] || 'Not specified'`
- **Location**: `/dashboard/requests` page
- **Commit**: `72c74bc`

#### **8. Dashboard Intermittent "No Jobs Yet" Issue**
- **Problem**: Dashboard randomly shows "No jobs found" even though jobs exist
  - Requires multiple page refreshes to load data
  - Intermittent connection failures
- **Root Cause**: Render free tier cold starts
  - Service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake service
  - Default fetch timeout causes request to fail
  - User sees empty dashboard and has to manually refresh
- **Fix**: Implemented automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
  - 60-second timeout for each request
  - Retries up to 3 times with increasing delays
  - Progress messages inform user of retry state
  - Manual retry button if all attempts fail
- **Result**: Dashboard gracefully handles cold starts without manual intervention
- **Commit**: `af7e234`

### Enhanced

#### **Backend API Structure**
- **Module Organization**: Clean geocoding module following NestJS best practices
- **Error Handling**: BadRequestException for invalid API keys or failed requests
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Configuration**: API key loaded from environment variables with validation
- **Logging**: Console logging for debugging API errors

#### **Frontend Integration**
- **Component Reusability**: AddressAutocomplete component used across multiple forms
  - Client job request form (`/client/request`)
  - Waypoint management component
- **User Experience**:
  - Instant address suggestions as user types
  - Clear loading indicators
  - Keyboard accessibility
  - Mobile-optimized touch targets
- **Data Flow**: Two-step process ensures GPS accuracy
  1. Autocomplete returns suggestions
  2. Place details fetches exact coordinates on selection
- **Dashboard Resilience**: Automatic recovery from backend downtime

### Technical Improvements

#### **API Migration Comparison**

**Legacy Places API (Deprecated):**
```javascript
GET https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/autocomplete/json?input=colombo&key=API_KEY
```

**Places API (New):**
```javascript
POST https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:autocomplete
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY
  X-Goog-FieldMask: suggestions.placePrediction.place,suggestions.placePrediction.placeId,...
Body:
  {
    "input": "colombo",
    "includedRegionCodes": ["LK"],
    "languageCode": "en"
  }
```

#### **Backend Proxy Pattern Benefits**
1. **Security**: API keys never exposed to browser
2. **Ad Blocker Proof**: No external script dependencies
3. **Rate Limiting**: Easier to implement server-side controls
4. **Provider Flexibility**: Can swap geocoding providers without frontend changes
5. **Caching**: Future opportunity for server-side response caching

#### **Retry Logic Implementation**
```typescript
const fetchWithRetry = async (url: string, options: RequestInit = {}, attempt: number = 0): Promise<Response> => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 60000); // 60s timeout

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { ...options, signal: controller.signal });
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return response;
  } catch (err) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    if (attempt < 3) {
      setRetryCount(attempt + 1);
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      return fetchWithRetry(url, options, attempt + 1);
    }

    throw err;
  }
};
```

- **Backend Proxy Benefits**: Prevents ad blocker issues, secures API keys, enables future caching
- **Retry Logic Pattern**: Can be reused for other endpoints that may experience cold starts
- **PlaceId Format**: Always ensure `places/` prefix when calling Place Details endpoint
- **Render Cold Starts**: Free tier services sleep after 15 minutes, consider keep-alive or paid tier for production

### Known Limitations
- **Render Free Tier**: Services sleep after inactivity, causing 30-60 second wake-up delays
- **First Load Delay**: Users may experience longer initial load times after inactivity
- **Autocomplete Language**: Currently hardcoded to English (en)
- **Country Filtering**: Defaults to Sri Lanka (LK), but configurable via query parameter

### Future Enhancements
1. **Keep-Alive Service**: Implement cron job to ping Render every 10 minutes during business hours
2. **Response Caching**: Add server-side caching for frequent address searches
3. **Multi-language Support**: Allow users to select preferred language for address results
4. **Recent Searches**: Store and suggest recently used addresses
5. **Render Upgrade**: Consider paid plan ($7/month) to eliminate cold starts

## [2025-10-17] - Resource Management & Client Portal Enhancements

### üéØ **Session Focus**: Complete CRUD API Implementation & Client-Side Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Resource Management System Complete** - Full CRUD operations for all logistics resources
**Achievement**: End-to-end resource creation with client-side visibility and job tracking

### Added

#### **1. Routes CRUD API** (`/apps/api/src/modules/routes/`)
- ‚úÖ **Complete Service Implementation**: `routes.service.ts` with full CRUD operations
  - **Multi-tenant Route Filtering**: Routes can be client-specific OR general (clientId = null)
  - **OR Query Logic**: Returns both client-assigned routes AND general routes for dropdown visibility
  - **Company-scoped Access Control**: All queries filtered by companyId
- ‚úÖ **DTOs Created**:
  - `create-route.dto.ts` - Validation for route creation with optional clientId
  - `update-route.dto.ts` - Partial update support
- ‚úÖ **Controller Endpoints**: POST, PATCH, DELETE added to `routes.controller.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Module Configuration**: RoutesService registered as provider in `routes.module.ts`
- **Key Feature**: Routes without clientId (general routes) appear in ALL client dropdowns

#### **2. Drivers CRUD API** (`/apps/api/src/modules/drivers/`)
- ‚úÖ **Complete Service Implementation**: `drivers.service.ts` with company-scoped operations
- ‚úÖ **DTOs Created**:
  - `create-driver.dto.ts` - Driver profile validation (name, licenseNo, phone, email)
  - `update-driver.dto.ts` - Partial driver updates
- ‚úÖ **Controller Endpoints**: POST, PATCH, DELETE for driver management
- ‚úÖ **Module Configuration**: DriversService provider registered
- **Client-side Visibility**: Drivers created by admin now appear in client job request forms

#### **3. Vehicles CRUD API** (`/apps/api/src/modules/vehicles/`)
- ‚úÖ **Complete Service Implementation**: `vehicles.service.ts` with detailed vehicle management
- ‚úÖ **DTOs Created**:
  - `create-vehicle.dto.ts` - Comprehensive vehicle data (regNo, class, make, model, year, kmpl, lease rates, maintenance costs)
  - `update-vehicle.dto.ts` - Vehicle profile updates
- ‚úÖ **Controller Endpoints**: POST, PATCH, DELETE for vehicle operations
- ‚úÖ **Module Configuration**: VehiclesService provider registered
- **Economic Tracking**: Supports kmpl, leasePerDay, maintPerKm for cost analysis

#### **4. Containers CRUD API** (`/apps/api/src/modules/containers/`)

- ‚úÖ **DTOs Created**:
  - `create-container.dto.ts` - Container validation (isoNo, size, owner, checkOk status)
  - `update-container.dto.ts` - Container status updates
- ‚úÖ **Controller Endpoints**: POST, PATCH, DELETE for container management
- ‚úÖ **Module Configuration**: ContainersService provider registered
- **Status Tracking**: Supports checkOk boolean for container readiness verification

### Fixed

#### **1. Client Job Visibility Issue**
- **Problem**: Jobs assigned by admin appeared on admin dashboard but NOT in client live activity or client dashboard
- **Root Cause**: `JobQueryDto` was missing `clientId` field, API ignored client-specific filtering
- **Fix**: Added `clientId` field to `job-query.dto.ts` (D:\Logistics App\logistics-platform\apps\api\src\modules\jobs\dto\job-query.dto.ts:11-14)
- **Updated Logic**: `jobs.service.ts` findAll method now properly filters by clientId (D:\Logistics App\logistics-platform\apps\api\src\modules\jobs\jobs.service.ts:87)
- **Result**: Client portal now shows only their assigned jobs in real-time
- **Backend Recompiled**: 5:54:03 PM - Zero errors

#### **2. Infinite GPS Map Loading on Client Job Detail Page**
- **Problem**: Map loading spinner never resolved on `/client/jobs/[id]` page, while dashboard tracking worked fine
- **Root Cause**: Missing robust loading pattern - no mounted state, cancelled flag, or requestAnimationFrame for DOM-ready detection
- **Fix Applied** (D:\Logistics App\logistics-platform\apps\web\src\app\client\jobs\[id]\page.tsx):
  - Added `mounted` state for component lifecycle tracking
  - Implemented `cancelled` flag to prevent race conditions on unmount
  - Added `requestAnimationFrame` loop for DOM-ready detection
  - Proper cleanup logic in useEffect return function
  - Console logging for debugging map loading sequence
  - Changed default map center to Colombo, Sri Lanka (6.9271, 79.8612)
- **Pattern Source**: Copied from working dashboard tracking implementation
- **Result**: GPS map now loads consistently on client job detail pages

#### **3. Socket.IO Connection for Mobile Tracking (In Progress)**
- **Problem**: Mobile tracker shows "Disconnected" when accessed via ngrok tunnel
- **Investigation**:
  - Read `SocketContext.tsx` (D:\Logistics App\logistics-platform\apps\web\src\contexts\SocketContext.tsx:42-52)
  - Previous implementation disabled Socket.IO entirely on ngrok detection
  - Returns empty string, preventing any WebSocket connection
- **Updated Strategy**:
  - Modified ngrok detection to USE `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` environment variable
  - Socket.IO configured with polling-first transport (works through ngrok)
  - Added proper logging for ngrok environment detection
- **Configuration**:
  - `.env.local` line 28: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` for backend API ngrok URL
  - Commented out by default to avoid affecting production
  - Uncomment when testing mobile tracker via ngrok
- **Status**: Pending ngrok tunnel setup and testing

### Enhanced

#### **Backend API Structure**
- **Service Layer Consistency**: All resource modules now follow identical CRUD pattern
- **Company-scoped Queries**: Every service enforces `companyId` filtering
- **Error Handling**: BadRequestException for invalid related entities, NotFoundException for missing resources
- **DTO Validation**: Class-validator decorators ensure type safety and data integrity
- **Module Organization**: Clean separation of controllers, services, DTOs, and module configuration

#### **Frontend Integration**
- **Resource Dropdowns**: Client forms now populate with admin-created routes, drivers, vehicles, containers
- **Real-time Job Tracking**: Jobs assigned to clients appear immediately in their dashboard
- **GPS Map Loading**: Robust loading pattern prevents infinite loading states
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Socket.IO configuration ready for ngrok mobile testing

### Technical Improvements

#### **Multi-tenant Resource Sharing**
- **General Routes Pattern**: Routes without clientId accessible to all clients within company
- **Client-specific Resources**: Optional clientId allows targeted resource assignment
- **OR Query Implementation**: Prisma query returns both general AND client-specific resources:
```typescript
where: {
  companyId,
  OR: [
    { clientId: clientId },
    { clientId: null }
  ]
}
```

#### **Google Maps Integration Patterns**
- **Mounted State Pattern**: Prevents map initialization before component mount
- **Cancelled Flag Pattern**: Stops async operations on component unmount
- **requestAnimationFrame Pattern**: Ensures DOM element exists before map creation
- **Cleanup Pattern**: Proper marker and map instance disposal on unmount

#### **Socket.IO ngrok Configuration**
- **Environment-based URL Resolution**: Dynamic Socket.IO URL selection based on environment
- **Polling Transport**: Configured to use polling first (compatible with ngrok tunnels)
- **Fallback Strategy**: HTTP polling when WebSocket unavailable
- **Mobile Testing Workflow**:
  1. Run `ngrok http 3004` for backend API
  2. Uncomment `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` in `.env.local` with ngrok URL
  3. Access mobile tracker via frontend ngrok URL
  4. Comment out when done testing
